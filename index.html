The signature plot was computed to select bands which are appropriate for the LULC classification model, selecting bands and removing unnecessary bands.

                <p> Sentinel Satellite image colour composite was then used to analyse the image class and prepare the image for creating training and testing dataset. True and False colour image composite were computed based on band combination of B8, B4 and B3 for False Colour and B4, B3 and B2 for True Colour. Training and testing samples were as water = 40, built-up = 55, forest = 55, sparse vegetation = 60, agriculture = 76, bare soil = 38 and sand beach = 23. The ratio of 70% training and 30% validation was applied to training the classifier and testing the performance of the classifier. </p>

            <p> NDVI is a widely known vegetation index that is often used to signifies the health of vegetation, other known vegetation index is Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Ration Vegetation Index (RVI) and Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI). NDBI is the index method which has not gained famous like NDVI. NDBI is used to highlight the built-up areas, like NDVI this model have its own formula. Other form of built-up index include Build-Up Index (BU) or Urban Index (UI). NDWI is used to enhance water bodies in most cases. Water has low reflectance and decreases from visible portion of spectrum. NDWI and MNDWI are widely used to highlight water, there is differentiated phenomenon between NDWI and MNDWI where MNDWI strongly highlight water than NDWI.   </p>

                <p> Finally, the LULC map were produced based on RF and SVM ML classifiers. Based on Figure, one can conclude the variability of LULC classes, where sparse vegetation is spread across the region and dominantly occurs in the northern part of the district. Based on the LULC classified map in Figure 8, NMB was classified into 7 different classes such as water bodies, built-up areas, forests, sparse vegetation, agriculture, barren land, and sand beaches. Some of the classes such as forest, sparse vegetation, and agriculture; bare land and sand were differentiated based on the reflectance of each pixel.  </p>

                <p>  Based on Table below, the dominant class is sparse vegetation in both RF and SVM, where it accounts for 730 〖km〗^2 for RF and 745 〖km〗^2 for SVM, followed by forest 681 〖km〗^2 and 721 〖km〗^2 for RF and SVM and NMB is least dominated by sand beach in both RF 21 〖km〗^2 and SVM 24 〖km〗^2. The statistics summary is represented in Figure by pie chart which demonstrate the classes and area accountability.</p>
